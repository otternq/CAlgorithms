A collection of algorithms written in C. Most algorithms come from "Introduction to Algorithms Third Edition"

Building
----
The project uses `make` to compile algorithms and tests.

Steps:
- Make a folder _bin_ (`make -f MakeFile start` or `mkdir bin`)
- Run the .TESTS target `make -f MakeFule .TESTS`

All executable tests are located in the _bin_ directory
